===========================================================

If you run the command line command "firefox" it will 
launch the Firefox browser.  Suppose you wanted to know
where the command is that launches firefox.  Running
the command "which firefox" will tell you that the 
"firefox" command is located at /usr/bin/firefox.  However,
"/usr/bin/firefox" is just a symbolic link, or symlink.  
Symlinks point to other files on the filesystem.  What is 
the ABSOLUTE PATH of the shell script pointed to by the 
symlink "/usr/bin/firefox"?

( EXAMPLE: /path/to/a/shell/script.sh )

ANSWER: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.sh
